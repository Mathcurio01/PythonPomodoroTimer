# Pomodoro Timer in Python

## Introduction

This Python script implements a **Pomodoro timer**, which is a time-management technique that involves working for a set duration (usually 25 minutes), followed by a short break (usually 5 minutes). This method is helpful for maintaining focus and productivity.

## How It Works

- **Work Duration**: The script will start with a 25-minute (default) work session.
- **Break Duration**: After the work session, you will get a 5-minute break.
- The timer will display the remaining time in `MM:SS` format, updating every second.
- Once the time is up, it will print `"Time's up!"` to indicate the end of the session.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries: `time` and `sys`

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Run the script in the terminal:

```bash
    python3 pomodoro_timer.py
```

3. The default work duration is 25 minutes and the break duration is 5 minutes. You can change these values by modifying the variables `work_duration` and `break_duration` in the script.

## Customization

- You can change the `work_duration` and `break_duration` by modifying the following lines in the code:
  
```python
work_duration = 25  # Change the work duration (in minutes)
break_duration = 5  # Change the break duration (in minutes)
```

## Example

- Start working for 25 minutes.
- After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break.

The script repeats this process in a single cycle. You can restart it as needed for additional Pomodoro cycles.
